2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
     I want to try a every test on connext testnet & website helping other run routers. And make a Medium to summarize How to do this thing (TH language) . I have plane for video but I'm not good at it but will try.

3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel
     I mostly learn from my friend in discord, I'm a newbie. But since I pass through the mission I can help others. I answer some question to my friend (our community) and Thai channel (Connext discord) about connext and router test.
