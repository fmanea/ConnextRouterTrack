	-	I tried out a few transactions across all 3 chains.

  	A few comments:
	
	-	I am really glad that the amarok version came out. I had been trying to spin up my router since november with previous releases and this new version made it way easier for me.
		
	-	The official guide could be a bit more precise sometimes. For example by mentioning that some settings like logdnakey are optional for a first run.
		
	-	I have been able to provide liquidity only through the coinhippo UI. The write section of smart contracts on etherscan didn't show addLiquidityFor.
		
	-	I wanted to be proactive and add the Goerli chain. As mentioned by my fellow colleagues in the channel, transactions are sometimes stuck.
		
	-	I was also looking if paid fees would be sent to the recipient address that I created (0xbb9dadcc8f205e742fa604aa7fa4dea7aecfd023) but nothing shows. I'll just learn about this in the near future I guess :)



2)	Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

	-	Spinning up a router on the testnet with minimum liveness requirements, and participating in any network-wide testing.
		
			All the way.

	-	Creating and improving docs and guides (in the form of text, video, or other).
		
			Would be glad to translate, also on request.

	-	Provide feedback and create improvement proposals.
		
			Also all the way.

	-	Building high impact tools to improve the RX.
		
			To the extend of my skills, with all my motivation.

	-	Running extra infrastructure that benefits Connect (ex: Graph Indexers).
		
			Not my priority, but if needed, why not.

  	-	Mentoring & support.
  		
			I can also interact with French and Spanish speaking colleagues.



3)	Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

	-  I made friends in particular with Siwat#7738. We've been giving out each other some insights through DM.
      Other than that for now, I thank my fellow router applicants for the help they provided me. I'll help them in return as soon as I get the opportunity.


## Router Track Mission 2 (16.05-23.05)

1)	Video guide with a step-by-step running router in any language

	-	I haven't been able to do it. Not enough time. It would have been my first try at this and I didn't want to rush it.



2)	Guides and your experience articles about running router in socials (medium etc.) in any language
	
	-	My french guide:

3)	Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

	-	I tried to be around the most I could. It's a busy period jobwise so nothing for now.



4)	Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools

	-	Generally speaking, it would be useful to know if there is some kind of roadmap or some big steps already planned in the development of nxtp. Directions, strategy. Also, some summary on the other tracks activities and achievements would be interesting.

	-	Regarding the router track, we could set up some kind of "ticket" system when users have issues. When support is needed, they would create a ticket, and then one of the contributors could accept to provide support. Then, if solved, the issue would be logged, and a feedback would be requested. This would help identifying common issues and present two main advantages: we could better the support, and at the same time see what issues come up more regularly. It would be an opportunity to improve the guides, clarify them. The development of the protocol could benefit from this data. We could also make a FAQ section anticipating these common issues. It's also a good tool to follow up on contributors.

	-	In the same way, when the general knowledge will be better (we are still mostly newbies), it would be interesting to implement some DAO tools to vote, or give out opinions on priorities. Given that this point is valid regarding my first observation on the roadmap of course.

## Router Track Mission 3 (23.05-30.05)

			https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/router/0xc4eac3bfae3f3c951225c16848ddcab3d6a5abbf

2)	Flash Challanges

	-	Flash challenge 1:
	
			Added my french guide to the list.
	
	-	Flash challenge 2:

			I have been intensely busy at work and barely found time to be home so I haven't been able to browse everything and worl on this. Sorry. I Will be more active in the future.
		
	-	Flash challenge 3:	
	
			I think ledger cold wallets support would be a plus. Especially for the recipient's address.
			Given what Rahul said it the router-track call of monday the 30th of may, funds would be safe there.
		
			Lots of projects use this solution so documentation on how to implement it is fully available.
		
			For the routers' addresses, explore the possibility of having to sign through the ledger upon router start.
		
			It's a common way of securing keys and moving funds over.

3)	Router Connext Quests

	-	As I said, may and the first two weeks of june is a busy period for me, jobwise. I'll be way more available in july and august (I will be on holiday).
