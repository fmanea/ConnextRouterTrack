	Feedback: Even the router is not friendly for beginner but with all the articles and videos in the community make it possible for anyone who wants to run.

	Improvement proposal: There are many suggestion or guideline in the pool, slight to huge difference. It’d be much easier for the beginner if we could categorized all the data  in one simple plain text. Furthermore, the command that will minimize the actions or script required from participant should be implemented.


2.Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

I’d write an articles and make a videos, especially in the router area, in simplest way. Including guideline of setting up and how to do several tasks in the test net

3.Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

I’ve been sticking around to support several questions which are in my understanding.

	Feedback: In order to make a video as a work, might reduce participants who want to participate but they’ve not had those resources. 
	Improvement proposal: writing articles and sharing knowledge, supportive in discord should be getting more attention in order to accumulate the point in the campaign. Real-time helping people in discord helps a lot for common users and also encourage them to dive deeper in the protocol with having a mentor.
