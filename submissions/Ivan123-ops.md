    I found spinning router quite easy, though official guide was a bit complicated. So I planned to do a russian guide (which can be read by any people because mostly there are commands)

2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

    I would like to write a guide, a video guide and help others spinning their routers and adding liquidity. 

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

    I answered people and helped them in Discord. I am going to keep it up!

 4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools 
       Everything is good so far. I wish you update router page to improve the design and make a faucet button on a router page. 
       Also waiting for Goerli to work. And maybe a leaderboard of routers to see how other routers do?
