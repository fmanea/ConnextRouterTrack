# Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)

1) Spinning up a router on the testnet

    - My Router address is: 0xaf6d59e0bC7A759709b74377DCF8f0ABAdD85BCe

    - Added liquidity: 0xf0c2dc19971c265a1952a6be4a8d23e8b7d2ddc255e4460dd4ef60cbd4e752a7

   

2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

    - I will try to come up with and implement a really useful tool for all routers.

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

    - I haven't been able to help anyone this week.
