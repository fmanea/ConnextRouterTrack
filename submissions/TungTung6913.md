Feedback: The test net is great. The page loading was very fast. UX/UI is also great and very friendly. We also can track our transaction along the way which is very good. However, the bridge seem to take times, and adding liqudity for Goeril still not avaliable

4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools

+ Feedback : 

- I got tx stucking during the bride for about 2 days, maybe it's about the 0.1.6 contract problem
- The step how to set up a router is kinda confuse and unclear for newcomer, but I already made some VDO guide and medium to mitigate this problem
- Overall UX/UI is very great. very user friendly, and I love the tracking tx that will show where the tx be at that time.

+Suggestion : 
- The guide should be more clearer
- Grafana dashboard is kinda hard to see the error, so might need to develop some tool that can track the error itself and maybe some tools that an alert if problems occur
