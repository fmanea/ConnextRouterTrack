    I think the guide is good for devops engineers who have some experience in setup a validator node/server, but for new newcomers have some confusion.
    For another improve, it's good if you have detail in step by step and explain more details why do this step.

2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
    -  Write technical/document article.
    - Develop tools to help validator track their status. 

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
