    I would probably mainly do documatations updating as well as help others solve problems. However, I am experienced in coding so I might do more if I have some spare time.

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

    1. Before the router UI was out, I was managed to come up a way to manually add liquidity on Rinkeby by directly calling the contract with constructed calldata. I shared it in discord which I think should have helped many operators: https://discord.com/channels/454734546869551114/966239886829060096/973624349745610812
    2. Helped others with common problems:
