## Router Track Mission 2 (09.05-16.05)

Spinning up a router on the testnet

1. Router address is: 0xe5784bBFdA0Ee1Ade117d0A91d3198f7D0B903d5

   Added liquidity 5000 on Rinkeby:

   Transaction Hashes:
   0x6e0d0e0b92ed7d0faa710cc6d583cf5718aa03e4331c87e362a308d466c6ecef

   Added liquidity on 5000 Kovan:

   Some of Transaction Hashes:
   0xe8baa172e856be4af33f106a67318653154262e4225045e684e3753b8e6ab98f

   When installing the router and adding liquidity, I encountered some problems that are not described in the manual or not described fully. However, with the support in discord I was able to do it correctly.
   In the future I want to write a guide for the Russian-speaking community

2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
   
   I would like to do router installation/configuration/improvement.
   I would also like to write detailed documentation for new members (in Russian)
   I also try to help new members in discord all the time.
