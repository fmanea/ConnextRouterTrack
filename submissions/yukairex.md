## Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)

1) Spinning up a router on the testnet

    - Router address is: 0x329Fb31B63729153D878808099A0b683FF665796

    - Added liquidity 1M on Rinkeby: 0x3631283def814c552808f1753c30efe50148ba89db909a98d70ff15c0fb4c844 

    - Added liquidity 1M on Kovan: 0xc02074b35ec8aed476f9e85dca0bb90f6425a73a244edb117b54e66cb64d7df8

    The guide on the https://docs.connext.network/Routers/spinning-up/ is quite straightforward to spin up a router. The only thing is that it took me some time to find the TEST token contracts on Rinkeby and Kovan because the link on the guide seems expired and linked me to a 404 page. I had to do some manual search and mint via etherscan. 

2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

   Writing guides, mentoring others onboard, build up subgraph/dune dashboard for utility
