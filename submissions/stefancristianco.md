## Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)

1. Spinning up a router on the testnet

   Router address is: 0x30429853aB95639396ee7DC360dB4aa2eE02cF4b

   Added liquidity 1000 TEST on Rinkeby:

   Transaction Hashes:
   0xccccb478330359eba74a9114e122f32e4833df15a6b91c0ed6a787e0f75eddaf

   Added liquidity on 1000 TEST on Kovan:

   Transaction Hashes:
   0xd8e0d00ddd417bc0f836022d6d19e79264a5694f57d9b118bfbfcc3d101e5e47

   Documentation on spinning up a router is not clear, but since I am a bit late in the game I already found resources online that helped fill the gaps.
   What could be improved:
   - Broken documentation links
   - Be more precise on what configuration paramenters are optional
   - Explain that router address must be whitelister before liquidity can be added


2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
   
   - Router installation/configuration/improvement.
   - Help new members and answer questions in discord.


3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

## Router Track Mission 2 (16.05-23.05)

## Router Track Mission 3 (23.05-30.05)

1. Testnet Upgrade - Add liquidity to the new contract

   At the time of instalation/configuration the new contracts were already available, so liquidity was added directly to the new contracts.

2. Flash Challanges

3. Router Connext Quests

   Quest 3 - Alerting system for Routers

   If I have the time I would like to build a tool that will send router alerts to a telegram bot. Maybe even allow some very limited commands to be executed on the target host (need to investigate more here).
