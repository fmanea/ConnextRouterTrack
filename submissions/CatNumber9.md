I can  install the router with ease, also for adding LP which I see our friends on discord struggle with adding rinkeby and Gorli network. But I found no ploblem with it and can add LPs in the first try. Not sure what happen because my address isn't even on WL.

Also the router run pretty smooth since I run it for many days and there is no issue, I check the log and everything everyday and it's still fine.




2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
- I will create medium on how to do the tasks once I understand it fully.




3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
- That's what I will do
