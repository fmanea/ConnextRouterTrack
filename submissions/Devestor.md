    - Mint Tokens on Rinkeby, Kovan, Görli

    - Added liquidity  5,000 on Rinkeby: 
    - Added liquidity  0 on Görli: 
    - Added liquidity  1,000 on Kovan:
    - Test Bridge Rinkeby to Kovan.
    
    I found some problems when add liquidity on Görli
    Error Message: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit 
    
    I will try to solve problems and share it on my medium page.
