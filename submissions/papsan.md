# Node setup
I configured the router and installed monitoring

My router address is: 0x43222ce7e77c395fd40Dd900076aDFe1a7E53F19

# Adding liquidity:
Honestly the design is not really user-friendly , I've spent an hour to find the router button (and it turned out that it simply did not exist)
And also it is not very convenient to add liquidity, there are no simple buttons for this, you should make steps that is not intuitive.. 
During Adding Router Liquidity in field chain I didn't found Kovan test-network. Please feel free to comment my pr if I doing smth wrong, thank you.

# Testing the bridge https://amarok-testnet.coinhippo.io/ 
- it works fine,tried to find fault with something, but it did not work out)) So , it works better than it was month ago and I see many nice updates and nothing to add. 
Just one problem than cannot be fix by the team , this is the transaction's speed , maybe we should think about another networks , like solana or avalanche or polygon.
