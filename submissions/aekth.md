    I have tried running the node on 4th June 2022
## Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)

## 1.Spinning up a router on the testnet
    My router address is: 0x8623ca2e10FeDFef7ad37008bE57695889aC93c1
    URL: https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/router/0x8623ca2e10FeDFef7ad37008bE57695889aC93c1



feedback :
   - After I have tried running the node on Linux OS (centOS), it is working fine but I have found that running node on Linux is not suitable for Linux novice users. I have encountered some issues during the installation. I personally think that we should have FAQ on installing and running the nodes on Linux OS for other inexperienced users to follow .
improvements proposals


## 2.Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
 - I want to learn and share knowledge in blockchain. helping community try to run node for beginner and creating article about running node.
