    I had some difficulties in the process of starting the router, but as they say, whoever goes, he will master the road.

2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

   now I would like to prepare an article for those who do not have experience in such activities. And judging by how many people have the role of router applicant and how many submissions have been made, many people have problems and they donâ€™t talk about them

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
