2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

    - I want to create a guide in my native language, post it on my twitter and post it on discord for other members.

    - If possible, I will try to help other participants with the installation and configuration of the router.

    - I also plan to launch additional infrastructure, such as graph indexers.

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

    - This week I helped the participants with the installation in the profile discords, next week I will try to devote more time to the main discord of the project.

4) Proposals: Adding more networks to test, for example, you can add Ropsten network.

## Router Track Mission 2 (16.05-23.05)

1) Video guide with a step-by-step running router in any language

    - Made a video in my native language about the launch of the Connext Router!

2) Guides and your experience articles about running router in socials (medium etc.) in any language

   - I wrote a guide in Russian, link:  
	https://teletype.in/@landeros/zd69DV9Z1lY
   - Also posted this guide on my twitter:
	https://twitter.com/landerosua_/status/1528740796534513666

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

   - I actively follow the discord, I hope my guide can help the community.

4) Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools

   - In general, everything is fine.It would be a good idea to evaluate the work for the past period and update it after each period of work (week) so that each participant can evaluate their efforts.

   - Unfortunately, I still cannot add liquidity to the Goerli network, I get an error.
