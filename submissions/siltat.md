    Feedback:
    -Spining up router
        I'm new ppl for connext community and this is 1st time for run node as I feel look like difficult to understand to use coding but I learn a lot from this community until I can open account and running node So, I will doing homework and translate to Video and share to community I think this way can help each other to run node to be success. 
    -Add liquidity
        The testing add liquidity look smooth and UI/UX easy to use I think if new people to join this activity can to it by no the guideline. 
        I have problem with add liquidity Görli network
    -Test Bridge
        The testing bridge look easy and smooth Rinkeby , Kovan are good for bridge but Görli cann't bridge maybe need allow to get whitelist.

2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
    I 'd like to create VDO to teach everyone setup and running node I think VDO will help new tester to easy understand and doing the task to be success and also translate guildline in medium.

3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel
    I'm new here with zero knowledge for Router but I will learn a lot from cummunity and then I will get involve to help each other in community.
