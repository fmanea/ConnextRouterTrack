# Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)


1. Spinning up a router on the testnet

My router address is: 0xe7b734DfaD0cF5F8305fbA39044049e3Af019b83
                      https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/router/0xe7b734DfaD0cF5F8305fbA39044049e3Af019b83

Test Bridge:     https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/tx/0x2286248b61658a4f14a8d46ab2fd6c9d7f4939b7cdb55e614db14958d92eb4a2

Feedback: The test net is great. The page loading was very fast. UX/UI is also great and very friendly. We also can track our transaction along the way
which is very good. However, the bridge seem to take times, and adding liqudity for Goeril still not avaliable

    I also help my friends in my community on how to run router


4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools 
      Feedback : Everything in the guide quite easy to follow the step, but there are 3 element, which are env, config.jason, and key,jason that is a bit
      confuse for new commer. Also, dashboard is not that clear to look at and there are some part that dashboard cannot pull data

      Suggestion : 1. a clear step on how to set up and fix those three element (env, config.fason, and key.jason), but I already create some tip and know how step 
                   to do it in my YT VDO and medium, so it might helo newcomer to easily understand.
                   2. improve the overall dashboard would be nice, and is it possible (not sure we can do it or not), if there are error occuring. They should
                   have some reminder popping up to in order for us to fix that immediately.
