Feedback: The test net is great. The page loading was very fast. UX/UI is also great and very friendly. We also can track our transaction along the way
which is very good. However, the bridge seem to take times, and adding liqudity for Goeril still not avaliable

2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
I will create a VDO clip teaching newbie on how to set up router and also right the "How to set up router in a TH language" to make new ppl understant more easily

1. Video guide with a step-by-step running router in any language
- I have crate a VDO guide on how to spin a Connext router in Thai with a detail step by step on how to set up it. I believe this will help a lot of newcomer to understand it.

2. Guides and your experience articles about running router in socials (medium etc.) in any language 
- I also wrote a guide in medium, so newcomer can look at the medium while they watch my VDO guide to make them have more better understanding

4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools
+ Feedback : 
- I got tx stucking during the bride for about 2 days, maybe it's about the 0.1.6 contract problem
- The step how to set up a router is kinda confuse and unclear for newcomer, but I already made some VDO guide and medium to mitigate this problem
- Overall UX/UI is very great. very user friendly, and I love the tracking tx that will show where the tx be at that time.
+Suggestion : 
- The guide should be more clearer
- Grafana dashboard is kinda hard to track the error and there is no alert showing if there are any problem, maybe developing some alearting tool and real time error tracker..
