# Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)


1. Spinning up a router on the testnet

My router address is: 0xe7b734DfaD0cF5F8305fbA39044049e3Af019b83
                      https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/router/0xe7b734DfaD0cF5F8305fbA39044049e3Af019b83

Test Bridge:     https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/tx/0x2286248b61658a4f14a8d46ab2fd6c9d7f4939b7cdb55e614db14958d92eb4a2

Feedback: The test net is great. The page loading was very fast. UX/UI is also great and very friendly. We also can track our transaction along the way
which is very good. However, the bridge seem to take times, and adding liqudity for Goeril still not avaliable



2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
    I will create a VDO clip teaching newbie on how to set up router and also right the "How to set up router in a TH language" to make new ppl understant 
    more easily
