    I think the guide is a bit confusing for newcomers as there are so incomplete sections in the website. However, I manage to run it and configure things so in the Mission 2, I will create  a step-by-step guide in my medium publication and also a youtube serie.

2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

    I would like to work in all the activity that my skill is capable to do. For making guides, and doing documentation, and code review and refactoring, these are what I can certainly contribute.

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

    Over the week, I have answered and helped some of the router track participants. I have learned and got help from them as well.

    Here are some of my contributions:
