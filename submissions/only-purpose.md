2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
- Spinning up a router on the testnet with minimum liveness requirements, and participating in any network-wide testing
- Creating and improving docs and guides (in the form of text, video, or other)
 
     - And of course I will try to show my creativity and skills in some other way   


3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
