# Router Track Mission 1-3


1. Spinning up a router on the testnet

My router address is: 0x82921cCd39479c4219958DE854D1cE25a7559983

2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
   For the first time, I think router is very difficult but easier than I thought, so I would like to create a video guild with an official guide.
   
   

3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel
    I mostly learn from my friend (jjzth), I'm a newbie.
