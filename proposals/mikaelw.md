# Router Connext Quests 3 - Alerting system for Routers

1. I propose to integrate Prometheus alert manager to send alerts to a discord channel. 

    - alertmanager and alertmanager-discord services will be added to the default docker-compose.yml file. 
    - Configuration files will be included with working settings.
  
2. Project completion by latest end of Router Track Mission 3, May 30.
3. Project success is verified by setting the DISCORD_WEBHOOK environment variable and seeing alert notifications in the designated discord channel.
4. Previous experiences include development of exchange software and management of 24/7 server infrastructure.    
5. Pull request submitted https://github.com/connext/nxtp-router-docker-compose/pull/15
