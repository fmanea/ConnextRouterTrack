## Router Track Proposal, Quest 2 - Quick router setup
I propose to quick-running routers on cloud platforms and dedicated servers using [my guide](https://github.com/martynovalek/NXTP-Router-setup).

I had prepared the script before I discovered the this quest. <br>
That's why the guide is already done. Some guys appreciated the convenience of this guide on discord. <br>
Hope you find it helpful
