4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools 
      Feedback : Everything in the guide quite easy to follow the step, but there are 3 element, which are env, config.jason, and key,jason that is a bit
      confuse for new commer. Also, dashboard is not that clear to look at and there are some part that dashboard cannot pull data
      
      Suggestion : 1. a clear step on how to set up and fix those three element (env, config.fason, and key.jason), but I already create some tip and know how step 
                   to do it in my YT VDO and medium, so it might helo newcomer to easily understand.
                   2. improve the overall dashboard would be nice, and is it possible (not sure we can do it or not), if there are error occuring. They should
                   have some reminder popping up to in order for us to fix that immediately.
