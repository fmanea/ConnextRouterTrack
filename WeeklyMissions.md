# Router Track Missions

Each week there will be some missions for the Router Track participants in which they will be rewarded with some points for delivering that activity.

## How to get maximum points? 

Key evaluation criteria are quality (for docs/ guides/mentoring) and impact (for improvement proposals,  feedback and tools). Connext should aim to be a self served platform also for routers, and we need to make sure documentations and guides serve this purpose. 

## ~~Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)~~

1. Spinning up a router on the testnet (10-30 points that depends on feedback /improvements proposals)
2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program (5 points)
3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

## ~~Router Track Mission 2 (16.05-23.05)~~

1. ~~Video guide with a step-by-step running router in any language (5-100 points)~~
2. ~~Guides and your experience articles about running router in socials (medium etc.) in any language (5-50 points)~~
3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools (5-500 points)

## ~~Router Track Mission 3 (23.05-30.05)~~
1. Testnet Upgrade - Add liquidity to the new contract (10-30 points)
2. Flash Challanges (10-100 points)
3. Router Connext Quests (10-500 points)

## ~~Router Track Mission 4 (08.06-23.06)~~

1. Improve connext docs. We have a lot of good guides - now we need to improve official documentation quality. Expected result is PR with edit in connext docs https://docs.connext.network/routers/intro (5-50 points)
2. Create your own quest. Donâ€™t have enough time / skills to create tool or improvement?  Just create a quest with your idea and get up to 100 points

## Router Track Mission 5 (24.06-03.07)

We realized that it would be better to work in a group/team of people to create something more meaningful/powerful. So this mission should be completed within the team. Detailed instructions on how to participate in team quests will be announced in discord. But here are general explanations:
- There will be a little team of 5 contributors + 1 mentor. 
- One team will complete one quest.
- Mentor helps the group to be on the right path. He has in-depth expertise in technologies and facilitates work to get quality instead of quantity.
- We create a private thread as a place for collaboration
- Team-mates work on quest together, discuss, comment PR, and help each other to get cool results
- Points are distributed according to the contribution of each team member (in terms of valuable edits in documentation, activity in PR's discussion, and sharing knowledge within the team)  
- At the end of the week mentor creates a PR with proposed edits

1. Team-quest 1. Intro. Create a simple but in-depth intro for router documentation with diagrams. Who are routers, why do we need them in Connext, how do they work, and which business model and risks do they have. The basic info is presented in the blog, but you can ask the team for any missing information.

2. Team-quest 2. Running router. Update spinning up router section with details, corner-cases, best practices, overview of automatization scripts and visualization where applicable.
