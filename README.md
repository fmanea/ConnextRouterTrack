# ConnextRouterTrack

## What is the Contributor Program?

The Contributor Program is a way for leaders in the community to step up and help push Connext forward in different ways. Connext’s official announcement gives you a detailed explanation of what the Contributor Program is. Here’s a summary:
> The Contributor Program is a community incentive program designed to encourage community members of different backgrounds and skillsets to steward and take ownership of key aspects of our ecosystem. The program consists of 5 Tracks (Community Leadership, Builders, Content & Education, Routers, and Grants), that are operated by Track Operators, experienced leaders within the community that are not part of the core team.

Participants of the program will be given points based on the quality of their contributions to the ecosystem using evaluation criteria developed by Track Operators. When the NEXT token goes live, we plan to submit a proposal to the Connext DAO to retroactively reward participants proportional to points received.

Be sure to join Connext's official Discord server to receive updates about the Content & Education track: https://discord.gg/connext, you can find us in the channel #router-track

## What is a router?

Routers are the liquidity and infrastructure providers of the Connext network. Their main purpose is to relay funds and calldata across chains. In exchange, they receive fees for their services.

# Router Track Missions

Each week there will be some missions for the Router Track participants in which they will be rewarded with some points for delivering that activity.


# Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)

1. Spinning up a router on the testnet (10-30 points that depends on feedback /improvements proposals)
2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program (5 points)
3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

### How to get maximum points? 

Key evaluation criteria are quality (for docs/ guides/mentoring) and impact (for improvement proposals,  feedback and tools). Connext should aim to be a self served platform also for routers, and we need to make sure documentations and guides serve this purpose.
